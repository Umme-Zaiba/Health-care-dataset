# Health-care-dataset-

Predict someone to no-show an appointment.

Created a model which can predict an outcome of the above statement with accuracy of 75%. Without normalisation(79%)

There are still many ammendments to be considered into this project, such as:

1. Visualise the data using matplotlib.
2. Create separate bar graphs to show the probability of showing up for male and female, day of the week and sms reminder. Describe your interpretation.
3. Analyse the probability of showing up with respect to different features. Create scatter plot and trend lines to analyse the relation between probability of showing up with respect to age/Houroftheday/awaitingtime. Describe your finding.
